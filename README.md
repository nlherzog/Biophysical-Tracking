# Biophysical-Tracking

This is a repository of all code used for the analysis in Herzog et. al 2025 manuscript titled "HSV-1 fluidizes the nucleus enabling condensate formation"

List of contents and purposes:
  batch-tracking is an ImageJ macro used for detecting and tracking nucGEMs
  StackReg_open-images is an ImageJ macro used for normalizing the position of a cell over time to enable better tracking of artificial condensates with TrackMate_Threshhold_Batch
  Save_Separate_Channels is an ImageJ macro used to create the nuclear max projection for cellpose input and separate channels for analysis
  extract_slices is an ImageJ macro used for pulling the pre-TFH treatment slice from the artificial condensate timelapse movies
  
  TrackMate_Threshhold_Batch is an ImageJ macro in Jython used for detecting and tracking artificial condensates
  
  alpha-logD_1anova is a python script used to run one-way ANOVA statistical analysis on alpha vs. logD data
  alpha-logD_ttest is a python script used to run Welch's t-test on alpha vs. logD data
  combine_pre-post is a python script used to combine the pre-TFH and post-TFH images into one timelapse for artificial condensate analysis
  further_GEMs is a python script used to extract angle distributions, step-size distributions, and alpha vs. logD plots from QC'd GEMSpa output (based on scripts from David Duran)
  msd_vs_tau is a python script used to extract msd vs. tau plots on a particular group from QC'd GEMSpa output (based on scripts from David Duran)
  Multiple_a-logD is a python script used to generate .csvs and preliminary plots for alpha vs. logD as comparisons between groups across multiple experiments
  new_multi_alpha-logD is a python script used to graph and alpha vs. logD plots as comparisons between groups across multiple experiments (from output generated by Multiple_a-logD)
  nuc_peri_split is a python script used to create separate masks for the periphery and interior of a full nuclear mask
  PNG_to_TIFF is a python script used to convert cellpose-generated masks to .tif files for GEMSpa or foci-counting input
  timesteps_MaxProj is a python script used to create 20 Hz, 10 Hz, and 4 Hz movies from 40 Hz movies for Halo-H2A tracking

  Artificial_Condensates is a python-based Jupyter notebook for analyzing each individual artificial condensate experiment
  Artificial_Condensates_Multi is a python-based Jupyter notebook for analyzing multiple artificial condensate experiments, including graphing and statistical analysis
  Graphing_Excel_Data is a python-based Jupyter notebook for analyzing pooled vRC formation from foci-counting outputs
